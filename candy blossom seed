    -- Sparkles removed as they don't match the provided image.
    -- To achieve the gradient effect from the image, you would typically:

    --

    Further Customization & Notes:

    1.  **Visual Appearance (Handle):**
        * The handle is now a light blue block.
        * To get the exact gradient from your image, you'll need to create a texture/image of that gradient.
          Then, you can apply it as a `Decal` to the faces of the `Handle` part.
          Example Decal snippet (inside createCandyBlossomSeedTool function):
            -- local frontDecal = Instance.new("Decal", handle)
            -- frontDecal.Texture = "rbxassetid://YOUR_GRADIENT_TEXTURE_ID_HERE"
            -- frontDecal.Face = Enum.NormalId.Front
            --
            -- local backDecal = Instance.new("Decal", handle)
            -- backDecal.Texture = "rbxassetid://YOUR_GRADIENT_TEXTURE_ID_HERE"
            -- backDecal.Face = Enum.NormalId.Back
            -- ... and so on for other faces if needed (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).

    2.  **Inventory Icon (`Tool.TextureId`):**
        * If you have a 2D image for the inventory icon, upload it to Roblox and set the `tool.TextureId` property to its asset ID (e.g., "rbxassetid://123456789").

    3.  **Planting Logic (`ActivateScript`):**
        * The `tool.Activated` event fires when the player clicks while the tool is equipped.
        * You need to fill in the logic for what happens when the seed is "planted."

    4.  **Quantity "[1x]":**
        * The "[1x]" in the name is just text. This script doesn't implement a true quantity system.

    5.  **Testing:**
        * Always test thoroughly in Roblox Studio. Check the Output window for any errors.
